# URI Launcher
This app takes an URI and shows which apps can handle it. If you tap on an app it will launch it with the URI as parameter. I made a similar app 3 years ago, but I lost the source and this version is much better, I hope. Although I don't work with Java that often, so my code is probably pretty bad.
(sorry for my bad english)
